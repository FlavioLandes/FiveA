# FiveA
FiveA is a heuristic algorithm to solve the one-dimensional cut problem. The algorithm consists of 5 methods:
* BP (Build Patterns): used to construct cutting patterns according to the instance.
* GRASP metaheuristic.
* ILS metaheuristic: used how local search of GRASP.
* Rising Method Non Ascending: used how local search of ILS.
* Remove Excess (RE): used to remove excess objects and setups from a solution. It is invoked by the Rising Method Non Ascending method.

FiveA was applied in a set of 1800 instances of the one-dimensional cut problem and managed to achieve competitive results with the literature methods compared.
